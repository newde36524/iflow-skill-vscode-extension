# Welcome to your VS Code Extension

## What's in the folder

* This folder contains all of the files necessary for your extension.
* `package.json` - this is the manifest file in which you declare your extension and command.
* The `src` folder contains your source code.
* The `out` folder contains the compiled JavaScript files.

## Get up and running straight away

* Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
* Run your command from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`) by typing `Hello World`.

## Make changes

* You can relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar after making changes to the files listed above.
* You can also reload (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R`) the VS Code window with your extension to load your changes.

## Explore the API

* You can open the full set of our API when you open the file `node_modules/@types/vscode/index.d.ts`.
